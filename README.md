# heroes-editor
A browser-based XML viewer for Heroes of the Storm.

## Basic Usage
- Select a Hero's data to view.
- Any CHero, CUnit, or CWeaponLegacy will be loaded automatically
- Additional tags can be loaded using the Load Tag dropdown
- When reading a tag, click any child marked in pink to open it to the right

## Todo List
- Get the close feature working, the red highlight is implemented
- Syntax highlighting in the Load Tag dropdown
- When opening a new frame, currently all matching children by id are opened. It would be nice to choose the class to narrow it down.
- Maybe allow frames to be moved up and down
- Maybe a navigate to parent / child button
